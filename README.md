# Pharmacat
A cutting edge Open Source HealthCare app(Android+Web) which utilizes Machine Learning to predict diseases based on Symptoms or Natural Language. Also includes features such as Live Chat with Doctors,Appointment Booking,Possible Drugs you can take and Specialist you can refer to.


## Motivation
With the amount of data present in today's age, we can diagnose common ailments and help reduce the workload on hospitals and doctors. Prognosis of common ailments through ML and NLP will also help patients save time and money by not having to travel long distances and physically consult doctors which is also tedious and time consuming. Moreover we still feel that having a doctor's final opinion is priceless and that ML cannot completely replace doctors. Hence our services provides virtual doctor consultations. Moreover in cases of emergency when going to a hospital is absolutely necessary we cannot waste time on booking appointments after reaching the hospital. Our service lets users check for doctors' availabiltiy in hospitals neraby and prebook appointments for emergency consultations. It also shows vacancies for particular doctors (those who sign-up) in nearby hospitals. We also provide basic medication suggestions for common aiements.
